My partner Ayesha and I made a website for those who want to track their daily calories during each meal time or any time they consume anything.

Here is a link to the website: https://infr3120-fall25-project-uyqu.onrender.com/meals here is a link to the repo for this assignment: https://github.com/PiratheeshG/INFR3120-Fall25-Project


Info About the Pages:

The Home page was made using JavaScript and EJS provides navigation to the meals pages. 
The meals page was made using JavaScript, EJS, and Express. It allows users to view their meal entries while providing options to create(add), read, update (edit), and delete entries.
MongoDB was used to create the database to store each meal entry, each entry made on the website or on MongoDB itself has multiple text fields to fill out (date, foodItem, consumptionTime, calorieAmount, weightofFood, and date).

   
Extra Notes:
-This assignment was developed using a full stack setup which included Express.js and Node.js for the backend or server side, MongoDB for data storage, and Bootstrap/Font Awesome for the styling and icons on the actual webpage.
- all my code was found through the lectures besides the following:
-how to add a static logo, I figured out how to do that from this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQAt1xfUWI
- needed to deploy the database from the cloud cluster and therefore needed a way to hide my credentials using .env and .gitignore and this youtube video helped
